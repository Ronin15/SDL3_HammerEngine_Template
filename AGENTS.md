## Build, Lint, and Test Commands

- **Build (Debug):**
  ```
  cmake -B build/ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  ninja -C build
  ```
- **Build (Release):**
  ```
  cmake -B build/ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ninja -C build
  ```
- **Run All Tests:**
  ```
  ./run_all_tests.sh --core-only
  ```
- **Run a Single Test:**
  ```
  ./tests/test_scripts/run_save_tests.sh --verbose
  ./tests/test_scripts/run_json_reader_tests.sh --verbose
  ./bin/debug/SaveManagerTests --run_test="TestSaveAndLoad*"
  ./bin/debug/json_reader_tests --run_test="TestBasicParsing"
  ```
- **Static Analysis:**
  ```
  ./tests/test_scripts/run_cppcheck_focused.sh
  ```
- **Valgrind Analysis:**
  ```
  # Complete analysis suite
  ./tests/valgrind/run_complete_valgrind_suite.sh
  
  # Quick memory check
  ./tests/valgrind/quick_memory_check.sh
  
  # Function profiling analysis
  ./tests/valgrind/callgrind_profiling_analysis.sh
  
  # Resource management profiling
  ./tests/valgrind/callgrind_profiling_analysis.sh resource_management
  
  # Cache performance analysis
  ./tests/valgrind/cache_performance_analysis.sh
  ```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Test executables are located in `bin/debug/` directory (project root), NOT in `build/bin/debug/`. Test scripts look for binaries in the correct location.

## Code Style Guidelines

- **C++ Standard:** C++20 required, enforced by CMake.
- **Memory Safety:** Use smart pointers (std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr). No raw pointers or manual new/delete. Follow RAII principles.
- **Lock-Free Structures:** Use atomic operations and lock-free data structures where possible for performance and thread safety.
- **Platform-Specific Code:** Use preprocessor guards (#ifdef __APPLE__, #ifdef WIN32) for OS-specific logic.
- **Naming:** Use descriptive names - UpperCamelCase for classes/enums/namespaces, lowerCamelCase for functions/variables, m_ prefix for member variables.
- **Imports:** Angle brackets <> for system/third-party headers, quotes "" for project headers. Group system headers first, then project headers.
- **Formatting:** 4-space indentation, braces on new lines for classes/functions, keep functions concise and focused.
- **Error Handling:** Always check return values, use try/catch for file/IO operations. Use logging macros (GAMEENGINE_ERROR, AI_MANAGER_CRITICAL, etc).
- **Logging:** Use provided logging macros extensively (see docs/Logger.md). CRITICAL/ERROR logs only in release builds for performance.
- **Testing:** Use Boost.Test framework with BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE, BOOST_CHECK, BOOST_REQUIRE. Clean up test artifacts and test error conditions.
- **Types:** Prefer STL types (std::string, std::vector, std::unordered_map). Use const and references where possible. Use std::string_view for read-only parameters.
- **Threading:** Use ThreadSystem with WorkerBudget for all threading. Avoid raw std::thread - use engine's task scheduling system.
- **Thread Safety:** Use std::atomic, std::shared_mutex, and lock-free structures. Follow cache-friendly data layout (SoA patterns).
- **File/Directory Handling:** Use std::filesystem for cross-platform path handling. Validate file permissions and clean up test artifacts.
- **Documentation:** Comment complex algorithms, document all public APIs with Doxygen-style comments, update relevant docs for new features.
- **Serialization System:** HammerEngine uses ISerializable interface with serialize(std::ostream&) and deserialize(std::istream&) methods. Use BinarySerial::Writer and BinarySerial::Reader classes for binary serialization, NOT BinarySerializer. See SaveGameManager and MockPlayer for examples.
- **Singleton Manager Pattern:** All singleton managers MUST implement proper shutdown handling to prevent double cleanup:
  - Add `bool m_isShutdown{false};` member variable
  - In destructor: `if (!m_isShutdown) { clean(); }`
  - In `clean()` method: Set `m_isShutdown = true;` before cleanup
  - Examples: SoundManager, EventManager, WorldResourceManager, ResourceTemplateManager
- **Aditional Instructions:** Please ask before removing the build dir, Only remove it when absolutley necessary. Updating cmake and then re-configruing fixes most build problems.

## Core Architectural Concepts

### Update/Render Synchronization

The engine uses a decoupled, two-thread model for game logic and rendering, orchestrated by the `GameEngine` and `GameLoop` classes. It is critical to understand this flow to avoid introducing data races or performance bottlenecks.

1.  **Two Main Threads:** The `GameLoop` starts and manages two primary threads: an **Update Thread** and a **Render Thread**.
2.  **`GameEngine` as the Conductor:** The `GameEngine` is the central point of synchronization. It ensures that the Render Thread never reads game state data while the Update Thread is actively modifying it.
3.  **Synchronization Mechanism:** The `GameEngine` uses a producer-consumer pattern with a `std::condition_variable` and atomic flags (`m_updateCondition`, `m_bufferReady`, etc.). This creates a clean "hand-off" at the end of each update cycle, guaranteeing that all asynchronous work is complete before rendering begins.
4.  **Manager-Level Parallelism:**
    *   The `GameEngine::update` method, running on the Update Thread, is the central dispatcher for all managers (`AIManager`, `EventManager`, etc.).
    *   Managers like `AIManager` can use the `ThreadSystem` to further parallelize their own internal tasks (e.g., processing AI behaviors across multiple cores).
5.  **Inherent Thread Safety:** Because the `GameEngine` waits for all update tasks to finish before the render phase begins, there is **no data race** between game logic (writers) and rendering (the reader). Do not add manual or redundant synchronization primitives like `waitForUpdatesToComplete()` inside the managers, as this will conflict with the engine's main synchronization loop and cause deadlocks.

## Warning Investigation and Fixes

### Unused Variable Warnings
When fixing unused variable warnings, **ALWAYS investigate whether the variable is actually needed** rather than just marking it as unused:

**Investigation Process:**
1. **Build with verbose output to identify all warnings:**
   ```bash
   ninja -C build clean && ninja -C build -v 2>&1 | grep -E "(warning|unused|error)"
   ```

2. **Examine the specific code context:**
   - Read the function where the warning occurs
   - Check if the variable serves a logical purpose
   - Look for similar usage patterns in nearby code
   - Verify if the variable was meant to be used but forgotten

3. **Apply appropriate fix:**
   - **Remove completely** if genuinely unused (preferred)
   - **Fix the logic** if variable should be used but isn't
   - **Only mark as unused** as last resort if needed for API compliance

**Examples of Fixed Issues:**
- `ChaseBehavior.cpp:69` - Removed unused `const AIManager &aiMgr = AIManager::Instance();` that was cached for "performance" but never used since function already uses cached player targets
- `WorldResourceManagerTests.cpp:475` - Removed meaningless `BOOST_CHECK(initialMemoryUsage >= 0);` since `size_t` is unsigned and always >= 0

**Warning Types to Fix:**
- `-Wunused-variable`: Variable declared but never referenced
- `-Wtype-limits`: Comparisons that are always true/false due to type limits
- `-Wunused-parameter`: Function parameters that aren't used

## Documentation Hygiene Checklist

When updating documentation, always:

1. **Check all links and anchors:**
   - Verify that every `[text](link)` and `[text](file.md#anchor)` points to an existing file and section.
   - Use your editorâ€™s search or a script to find all Markdown links and anchors.
2. **Update summaries and navigation:**
   - If you add, remove, or rename a doc, update the relevant summary/index (e.g., this file, managers/README.md).
   - Ensure the Table of Contents and quick links match the actual content.
3. **Spot-check deep links:**
   - For new or changed docs, check that the summary/description in the index matches the actual content.
4. **Keep platform notes and setup instructions current:**
   - Update platform-specific instructions if dependencies or build steps change.
5. **Test documentation navigation:**
   - Open docs in a Markdown viewer and click through links to ensure there are no dead ends.
6. **Document new features:**
   - Add new features to the appropriate section and update the index/quick links.
7. **Remove or update outdated content:**
   - Delete or revise obsolete instructions, links, or references.

> Following this checklist ensures the documentation remains robust, accurate, and easy for new contributors to navigate.
