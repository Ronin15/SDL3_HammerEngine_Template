# Event Alignment Update Changelog

## Overview
Major refactoring of the event system to create a centralized, thread-safe, and high-performance event architecture. This update establishes the EventManager as the central controller of the engine with improved event processing, tracking, and alignment.

## Core Event System Improvements

### EventManager Refactoring
- **Thread-Safe Architecture**: Redesigned EventManager for safe concurrent access
- **Central Event Controller**: EventManager now serves as the primary event coordinator for the entire engine
- **Enhanced Event Processing**: Improved event queuing, processing, and tracking mechanisms
- **Performance Optimizations**: Streamlined event handling for better performance
- **Event Factory Integration**: Added comprehensive EventFactory system for type-safe event creation

### Event System Components
- **EventFactory.cpp/hpp**: New factory pattern implementation for event creation (138+ lines)
- **EventTypeId.hpp**: Enhanced event type identification system
- **Event Processing Pipeline**: Improved event lifecycle management and processing flow

## AI System Alignment

### Behavior System Updates
- **Removed Frame Staggering**: Eliminated complex frame staggering code from AI system for cleaner processing
- **Behavior Optimization**: Updated AI behaviors (Chase, Guard, Patrol, Wander, etc.) for event-driven architecture
- **Entity Ownership Clarification**: GameState now clearly owns all spawned entities while managers handle their lifecycle

### AI Behavior Improvements
- **ChaseBehavior.cpp**: Major refactoring (131+ lines changed)
- **PatrolBehavior.cpp**: Significant updates (97+ lines changed)
- **Enhanced Trigger Methods**: Added new trigger methods to event manager API for AI integration
