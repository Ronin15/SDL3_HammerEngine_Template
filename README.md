# SDL3 HammerEngine Template

A modern, production-ready C++20 SDL3 game engine template for 2D games. Built for rapid prototyping and scalable game development, it features robust multi-threading, high-performance AI, a professional UI system, and comprehensive resource and event management. Designed for cross-platform deployment (Windows, macOS, Linux) with a focus on performance, safety, and extensibility.

## Key Features

- **Modern C++20 & SDL3 Core**  
  Clean, modular codebase with strict style, memory, and type safety.

- **Advanced Multi-Threading**  
  Production-grade thread pool with priority-based scheduling and WorkerBudget system for intelligent, hardware-adaptive resource allocation. Lock-free double buffering and batch task submission for optimal concurrency.

- **High-Performance AI System**  
  Cache-friendly, lock-free, and batch-processed AI manager. Supports 10K+ entities at 60+ FPS with only 4-6% CPU usage. Includes dynamic behaviors (Wander, Patrol, Guard, Flee, Attack, etc.), message system, and distance-based culling.

- **Robust Event & State Management**  
  Event-driven architecture with batch event processing, state machines for entities and game flow, and thread-safe manager updates.

- **Professional UI System**  
  Content-aware auto-sizing, professional theming (light/dark/custom), and a rich set of components (buttons, labels, input fields, lists, modals, etc.). Responsive, DPI-aware, and cross-platform with layout and animation support.

- **Automatic Resource Management**  
  JSON-based resource loading for items, materials, currency, and custom types. Handle-based runtime access for performance and extensibility.

- **Fast, Safe Serialization**  
  Header-only, cross-platform binary serialization system with smart pointer memory management. Used by SaveGameManager for robust, versioned save/load.

- **Comprehensive Testing & Analysis**  
  Extensive Boost.Test suite, static analysis (cppcheck), and Valgrind integration for performance, memory, and thread safety validation.

- **Cross-Platform Optimizations**  
  Unified codebase with platform-specific enhancements: macOS letterbox mode, Wayland detection, adaptive VSync, and DPI scaling.

- **Extensive Documentation**  
  Full guides, API references, best practices, and troubleshooting for all major systems.

### Why Choose HammerEngine Template?
