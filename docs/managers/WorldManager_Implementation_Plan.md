# WorldManager Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `WorldManager`, a new engine component responsible for procedurally generating, managing, and rendering a grid-based game world. The design emphasizes modularity, data-driven configuration, and deep integration with existing engine systems like the `EventManager` and `WorldResourceManager`.

## ðŸš€ Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components
- **Core Architecture**: All primary files created and implemented
- **Data Structures**: `WorldData.hpp` with all planned structs and enums
- **World Generator**: Full procedural generation pipeline implemented
- **WorldManager Class**: Complete singleton implementation with thread safety
- **TileRenderer**: ASCII-based rendering system implemented
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suites for both WorldGenerator and WorldManager
- **Error Handling**: Robust bounds checking and validation
- **Thread Safety**: Full thread-safe implementation with shared_mutex

### ðŸ”§ Partially Completed
- **GameState Integration**: WorldManager is referenced in GamePlayState and EventDemoState but not fully integrated into lifecycle management
- **Event System Integration**: Event handling structure implemented but specific event types may need definition
- **Resource Manager Integration**: Structure exists but full integration pending

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks
- **Complete GameState Integration**: Implement `loadNewWorld()` calls in `GamePlayState::onEnter()` and `unloadWorld()` in `GamePlayState::onExit()`
- **Event Types Definition**: Define and implement `WorldLoadedEvent`, `TileChangedEvent`, and `HarvestResourceEvent`
- **Resource Manager Integration**: Complete integration with `WorldResourceManager` for resource tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement and test viewport-based rendering optimizations
- **Advanced Features**: Consider implementing save/load functionality for generated worlds

-   **Responsibilities:** âœ… All implemented
    -   âœ… Manages the lifecycle of the active `WorldData` object
    -   âœ… Acts as the primary API for other systems to interact with the world (e.g., `getTileAt(x, y)`)
    -   âœ… Orchestrates world loading and unloading
    -   ðŸ”§ Integrates with other managers (`EventManager`, `WorldResourceManager`) - Structure implemented, full integration pending
    -   âœ… Manages the `TileRenderer` and the camera/viewport for optimized rendering

-   **Pattern:** Standalone utility class âœ…
-   **Responsibilities:** âœ… All implemented
    -   âœ… Contains all procedural generation logic
    -   âœ… Implements a modular pipeline to generate the world
    -   âœ… Takes a `WorldGenerationConfig` and produces a `std::unique_ptr<WorldData>`

#### Generation Pipeline: âœ… COMPLETED

All pipeline stages have been fully implemented:

1.  âœ… `generateNoiseMaps()`: Creates elevation and humidity maps using custom Perlin noise implementation
2.  âœ… `assignBiomes()`: Assigns a `Biome` to each tile based on noise values
3.  âœ… `createWaterBodies()`: Forms water bodies based on elevation threshold
4.  âœ… `distributeObstacles()`: Places obstacles based on biome-specific rules
5.  âœ… `calculateInitialResources()`: Creates a summary of harvestable resources in the newly generated world

### 3.3. `TileRenderer` âœ… COMPLETED

**Additional Implementation:**
- âœ… Embedded within `WorldManager.hpp` as a supporting class
- âœ… ASCII-based rendering using codepage 437 characters
- âœ… Viewport-based rendering for performance optimization
- âœ… Color mapping for different biomes and obstacles
- âœ… Optimized rendering with viewport padding for smooth scrolling

## 4. Integration with Engine Systems

### 4.1. `WorldResourceManager` ðŸ”§ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

Structure implemented but full integration pending:

-   âœ… API structure exists in `WorldManager` for resource integration
-   ðŸ“‹ **TODO**: Complete implementation of `initializeWorldResources()` method
-   ðŸ“‹ **TODO**: When a new world is loaded, `WorldManager` should:
    1.  Call `WorldResourceManager::Instance().createWorld(worldId)` to register the new world space
    2.  Use the initial resource summary from the `WorldGenerator` to populate the `WorldResourceManager` with the world's starting resource totals via `addResource()`

### 4.2. `EventManager` ðŸ”§ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

Event handling structure implemented but specific event types need definition:

-   âœ… Event registration/unregistration methods implemented in `WorldManager`
-   âœ… Event firing methods implemented (`fireTileChangedEvent`, `fireWorldLoadedEvent`, etc.)
-   ðŸ“‹ **TODO**: Define specific event types:

    **Events to be Emitted by `WorldManager`:**
    -   ðŸ“‹ `WorldLoadedEvent(worldId)`: Fired after a new world is loaded and initialized
    -   ðŸ“‹ `TileChangedEvent(x, y, newTileState)`: Fired when a tile's state is modified

    **Events to be Handled by `WorldManager`:**
    -   ðŸ“‹ `HarvestResourceEvent(entityId, targetX, targetY)`: On this event, the `WorldManager` should:
        1.  Update the tile at `(targetX, targetY)` (e.g., remove a tree)
        2.  Notify the `WorldResourceManager` to decrement the corresponding resource count for the world
        3.  Fire a `TileChangedEvent`

### 4.3. `GameStateManager` ðŸ”§ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

Basic integration exists but lifecycle management needs completion:

-   âœ… `WorldManager` is included and used in `GamePlayState` and `EventDemoState`
-   âœ… World bounds checking is implemented in game states
-   ðŸ“‹ **TODO**: Complete lifecycle integration:
    -   ðŸ“‹ `GamePlayState::onEnter()` should trigger `WorldManager::Instance().loadNewWorld(...)`
    -   ðŸ“‹ `GamePlayState::onExit()` should trigger `WorldManager::Instance().unloadWorld()`

## 5. Rendering âœ… COMPLETED

### 5.1. `TileRenderer` âœ… COMPLETED

All planned rendering functionality has been implemented:

-   âœ… A dedicated rendering class has been created to handle drawing the world
-   âœ… Responsible for translating `Tile` data into visual output
-   âœ… **Initial Implementation**: Uses `FontManager` to draw codepage 437 characters with full character and color mapping for each `Tile` state (biome, obstacle, water)
-   âœ… **Upgrade Path**: The `TileRenderer` can be modified to use `TextureManager` to draw sprites/textures instead, without requiring any changes to the `WorldManager`

### 5.2. Optimized Rendering âœ… COMPLETED

All performance optimizations have been implemented:

-   âœ… The `WorldManager::render()` method does not draw the entire world every frame
-   âœ… Determines the visible tile range based on camera position and zoom level
-   âœ… Instructs the `TileRenderer` to only draw tiles within the viewport
-   âœ… Includes viewport padding (`VIEWPORT_PADDING = 2`) for smooth scrolling
-   âœ… Full camera management with configurable viewport dimensions

## 6. Unit Testing âœ… COMPLETED

All planned testing has been implemented with comprehensive coverage:

-   âœ… **`WorldGeneratorTests`** (`tests/world/WorldGeneratorTests.cpp`):
    -   âœ… Deterministic generation testing: Given a constant seed, verify that the generated world is identical on every run
    -   âœ… Biome distribution validation: Test biome distribution rules (e.g., swamps are in low-lying areas)
    -   âœ… Obstacle placement testing: Test that obstacle placement follows biome rules
    -   âœ… World configuration validation: Test various generation parameters
    -   âœ… Edge case handling: Test invalid configurations and boundary conditions

-   âœ… **`WorldManagerTests`** (`tests/world/WorldManagerTests.cpp`):
    -   âœ… Public API testing: `loadNewWorld`, `getTileAt`, `unloadWorld`
    -   âœ… Bounds checking: Verify correct handling of out-of-bounds requests
    -   âœ… Thread safety testing: Concurrent access validation
    -   âœ… Camera and viewport functionality testing
    -   âœ… Resource handle integration testing
    -   âœ… Initialization and cleanup testing

-   ðŸ“‹ **Integration Tests** (TODO):
    -   ðŸ“‹ Simulate a `HarvestResourceEvent` and verify that the `WorldManager`, `WorldResourceManager`, and a mock entity's inventory are all updated correctly
    -   ðŸ“‹ Verify that a `WorldLoadedEvent` is fired with the correct data
